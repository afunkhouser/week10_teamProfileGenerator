## Description
Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

## Installation
Run 'npm i' in the command line to install all the necessary dependencies.
The application can be invoked by the command: node index.js

## Usage
After running the command "node index.js" continue to answer the questions as they appear. Your answer to these questions will be the text used to develope your team profile. Then the HTML page will render in the dist folder
